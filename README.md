# StudentPerformancePredictor
## 📌 Project Overview

The aim of this project is to provide an easy-to-use interface where users can input student details and get a performance prediction. It can be useful for educators, parents, or academic institutions to identify students at risk.

## 🚀 Features

- Trained ML model to predict student scores
- Clean and interactive web interface
- Input fields for relevant academic and lifestyle data
- Real-time prediction results

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.10**
- **Pandas, NumPy** – for data manipulation
- **Scikit-learn** – for building the ML model
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – for data visualization
- **Streamlit** or **Flask** – for the web interface (mention whichever you're using)

## 📊 How It Works

1. Dataset is loaded and preprocessed.
2. Model is trained using features like:
   - Study time
   - Previous grades
   - Attendance
   - Internet access, etc.
3. User inputs data via a form on the web page.
4. Model predicts and displays the student's performance level.
